# USB-Based RFID System with Railway Deployment

This guide covers deploying your RFID system with **ESP32 connected via USB** and **web application + database on Railway**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
[RFID Card] → [ESP32] → [USB Serial] → [Local Bridge] → [Railway API] → [Cloud Database]
                                            ↓
[Local Computer] ← [USB Cable] ← [ESP32]   [Railway Web App] ← [Landlord Interface]
```

### **Advantages of This Setup:**
- 🔒 **More Secure** - No wireless transmission to intercept
- ⚡ **Faster Response** - Direct serial communication
- 🔋 **Power + Data** - Single USB cable
- 🌐 **Cloud Benefits** - Scalable database and web interface
- 🛡️ **Reliable** - No WiFi dependencies
- 💰 **Cost Effective** - No additional networking hardware needed

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Web Application to Railway

Follow the standard Railway deployment:

```bash
# Deploy your Laravel app to Railway
railway login
railway init
railway up

# Add MySQL service in Railway dashboard
# Set environment variables
railway run php artisan migrate --force
```

Your web application will be live at: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

### 2. Set Up Local ESP32 Bridge

#### Hardware Setup
```
RFID RC522    ESP32
VCC       ->  3.3V
RST       ->  GPIO 0
GND       ->  GND
MISO      ->  GPIO 19
MOSI      ->  GPIO 23
SCK       ->  GPIO 18
SDA(SS)   ->  GPIO 5

ESP32     ->  Computer
USB       ->  USB Port (COM7, etc.)
```

#### ESP32 Code
Use your original ESP32 code (no WiFi needed):

```cpp
#include <SPI.h>
#include <MFRC522.h>
#include <ArduinoJson.h>

// RFID Configuration
#define SS_PIN  5
#define RST_PIN 0

// Initialize RFID reader
MFRC522 rfid(SS_PIN, RST_PIN);

// Your existing code works perfectly!
// No changes needed for USB communication
```

#### Start the Bridge
```bash
# Option 1: Use the batch file
start_railway_bridge.bat COM7 115200 https://your-app.up.railway.app

# Option 2: Run directly
php esp32_railway_bridge.php COM7 115200 https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

## 🔧 Bridge Script Features

### **Real-time Communication**
- ✅ Reads JSON data from ESP32 via USB
- ✅ Forwards to Railway API for validation
- ✅ Returns access results to ESP32
- ✅ Logs all activity locally and in cloud

### **Error Handling**
- ✅ Automatic reconnection to serial port
- ✅ Railway API health checks every 5 minutes
- ✅ Graceful handling of network issues
- ✅ Detailed logging and error reporting

### **Security Features**
- ✅ Rate limiting protection
- ✅ Request validation
- ✅ Secure HTTPS communication
- ✅ Complete audit trail

## 📊 Data Flow

### 1. Card Scan
```
ESP32 detects card → Sends JSON via USB → Bridge receives data
```

### 2. Validation
```
Bridge → Railway API → Database lookup → Access decision
```

### 3. Response
```
Railway API → Bridge → ESP32 → Access granted/denied
```

### 4. Logging
```
All attempts logged in Railway database → Visible in web interface
```

```

## 🌐 Web Interface

### **Landlord Dashboard**
- Access via: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/login`
- Navigate to **Security** section
- Manage RFID cards and view access logs

### **Features Available:**
- ✅ Assign RFID cards to tenants
- ✅ View real-time access attempts
- ✅ Generate access reports
- ✅ Manage card status (active/inactive)
- ✅ Set card expiration dates
- ✅ Mark cards as lost/stolen

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Bridge Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check COM port
mode  # Windows
ls /dev/tty*  # Linux/Mac

# Test serial connection
# Make sure no other program is using the port
# Try different COM ports if needed
```

### **Railway API Issues**
```bash
# Test API directly
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/rfid/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"card_uid":"TEST123","reader_location":"main_entrance"}'

# Check Railway logs
railway logs
```

### **ESP32 Issues**
- Verify USB cable connection
- Check COM port in Device Manager
- Ensure ESP32 drivers are installed
- Monitor Serial output in Arduino IDE

## 🔄 Bridge Auto-Restart

### **Windows Service (Optional)**
Create a Windows service to auto-start the bridge:

```batch
# Create bridge-service.bat
@echo off
:loop
php esp32_railway_bridge.php COM7 115200 https://your-app.up.railway.app
timeout /t 5
goto loop
```

### **Linux Systemd Service (Optional)**
```ini
[Unit]
Description=ESP32 Railway Bridge
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your-user
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/project
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php esp32_railway_bridge.php /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 https://your-app.up.railway.app
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
