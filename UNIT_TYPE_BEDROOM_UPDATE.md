# 🏠 Unit Type & Bedroom Auto-Population Update

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Removed "Duplex" from Unit Type Options**
- ❌ Duplex option removed from create unit form
- ❌ Duplex option removed from edit unit modal

### 2. **Auto-Populate Bedrooms Based on Unit Type**
- ✅ Number of bedrooms now automatically populates when unit type is selected
- ✅ Bedrooms field is now **read-only** (auto-filled)
- ✅ Works in both create and edit forms

---

## 📋 Unit Type → Bedroom Mapping

| Unit Type | Bedrooms Auto-Set |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Studio** | 0 |
| **One Bedroom** | 1 |
| **Two Bedroom** | 2 |
| **Three Bedroom** | 3 |
| **Penthouse** | 3 (default) |

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Create New Unit:**
1. Select **Unit Type** (e.g., "Three Bedroom")
2. **Number of Bedrooms** automatically changes to **3**
3. Bedrooms field is read-only (can't be manually changed)
4. User continues with other fields (bathrooms, rent, etc.)

### **Edit Existing Unit:**
1. Open edit modal
2. Change **Unit Type** (e.g., from "Two Bedroom" to "Three Bedroom")
3. **Bedrooms** automatically updates to **3**
4. Save changes

## 💡 User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- ❌ User had to manually enter bedroom count
- ❌ Could create "Two Bedroom" unit with 5 bedrooms (inconsistent)
- ❌ Duplex option was confusing (not a standard unit type)

**After:**
- ✅ Bedroom count automatically matches unit type
- ✅ No data inconsistency possible
- ✅ Cleaner unit type options
- ✅ Faster unit creation process
- ✅ Clear visual indicators (read-only field + helper text)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**

1. **`resources/views/landlord/create-unit.blade.php`**
   - Removed Duplex option from dropdown
   - Made bedrooms input read-only
   - Added helper text "Auto-filled based on unit type"
   - Added JavaScript to auto-populate bedrooms on unit type change

2. **`resources/views/landlord/units.blade.php`**
   - Removed Duplex option from edit modal
   - Made bedrooms input read-only in edit modal
   - Added helper text "Auto-filled based on unit type"
   - Added JavaScript event listener in edit modal to auto-populate bedrooms

---

## 📝 JavaScript Logic

### **Create Form:**
```javascript
unitTypeSelect.addEventListener('change', function() {
    const unitType = this.value;
    let bedroomCount = 0;

    switch(unitType) {
        case 'studio':
            bedroomCount = 0;
            break;
        case 'one_bedroom':
            bedroomCount = 1;
            break;
        case 'two_bedroom':
            bedroomCount = 2;
            break;
        case 'three_bedroom':
            bedroomCount = 3;
            break;
        case 'penthouse':
            bedroomCount = 3; // Default for penthouse
            break;
        default:
            bedroomCount = 0;
    }

    bedroomsInput.value = bedroomCount;
});
```

### **Edit Modal:**
- Same logic applied dynamically after modal content loads
- Event listener attached when modal is populated with unit data
- Ensures consistent behavior across create and edit

---

## ✨ Visual Indicators

### **Helper Text Added:**
- **Under Unit Type:** "Number of bedrooms will be set based on your selection"
- **Under Bedrooms:** "Auto-filled based on unit type"

### **Field State:**
- Bedrooms input has `readonly` attribute
- Slight visual difference to indicate auto-filled field
- User cannot manually edit the value

---

## 🎯 Data Consistency Benefits

### **Prevents Common Issues:**
1. ❌ **Before:** User could create "Studio" with 2 bedrooms
   - ✅ **Now:** Studio always = 0 bedrooms

2. ❌ **Before:** "Three Bedroom" unit might have 1 bedroom entered
   - ✅ **Now:** Three Bedroom always = 3 bedrooms

3. ❌ **Before:** Duplex type was unclear (is it a unit type or property type?)
   - ✅ **Now:** Only clear residential unit types available

---

## 📊 Available Unit Types (After Update)

### **Remaining Options:**
1. ✅ **Studio** - Open layout, no separate bedroom
2. ✅ **One Bedroom** - Single bedroom unit
3. ✅ **Two Bedroom** - Two bedroom unit
4. ✅ **Three Bedroom** - Three bedroom unit
5. ✅ **Penthouse** - Premium top-floor unit (defaults to 3 bedrooms)

### **Removed:**
- ❌ **Duplex** - Removed as it's more of a property type than unit type

---

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

### **Existing Units:**
- Units already created with "Duplex" type will continue to work
- No data migration needed
- Only affects new unit creation and future edits
- When editing old "Duplex" units, landlord must select a new type

---

## 🎨 UX Flow Example

### **Creating a Three Bedroom Unit:**

**Step 1:** Fill Basic Information
```
Unit Number: 305
Unit Type: [Select Three Bedroom] ← User selects this
```

**Step 2:** Room Configuration (Auto-populated)
```
Number of Bedrooms: 3 (read-only) ← Automatically filled!
Number of Bathrooms: [User enters this]
```

**Result:** Perfect data consistency! ✨

## 💬 User Feedback

The update includes helpful text to guide users:

### **On Create Form:**
> "Number of bedrooms will be set based on your selection"

### **On Bedroom Field:**
> "Auto-filled based on unit type"

This ensures users understand why the field is read-only and how the automation works.
