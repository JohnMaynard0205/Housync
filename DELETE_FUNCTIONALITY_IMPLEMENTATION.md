# Delete Property & Unit Functionality Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Property Deletion Not Working
**Problem:** Properties couldn't be deleted because the system prevented deletion when units existed, but there was no way to delete units.

**Root Cause:** The `deleteApartment` method had a constraint check that blocked deletion of properties with units, but no `deleteUnit` functionality existed.

### Issue 2: No Delete Unit Functionality
**Problem:** There was no way to delete units at all - no route, no controller method, no UI button.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Delete Unit Functionality

#### Controller Method (LandlordController.php)
**Location:** Lines 323-352

**Features:**
- Verifies landlord ownership of the unit
- Checks for active tenant assignments (blocks deletion if found)
- Allows deletion only for units without active tenants
- Deletes terminated/completed assignments before removing unit
- Provides clear success/error messages
- Logs errors for debugging

**Safety Checks:**
```php
// Cannot delete units with active tenant assignments
$activeAssignments = $unit->tenantAssignments()
    ->whereIn('status', ['active', 'pending'])
    ->count();
```

#### Route (web.php)
**Location:** Line 76
```php
Route::delete('/units/{id}', [LandlordController::class, 'deleteUnit'])
    ->name('delete-unit')
    ->whereNumber('id');
```

#### UI Implementation (units.blade.php)

**Delete Button Added:** Lines 747-749
```html
<a href="#" class="btn btn-danger btn-sm" 
   onclick="deleteUnit({{ $unit->id }}, '{{ $unit->unit_number }}')">
    <i class="fas fa-trash"></i> Delete
</a>
```

**JavaScript Function:** Lines 1199-1223
- Confirms deletion with user
- Shows warning about active tenant restrictions
- Creates and submits DELETE form with CSRF protection
- Provides clear user feedback

### 2. Improved Property Deletion

#### Enhanced Error Messages (LandlordController.php)
**Location:** Lines 147-177

**Improvements:**
1. **Active Tenant Check**
   - Counts units with active tenant assignments
   - Shows specific count in error message
   - Guides user to terminate assignments first

2. **Unit Count Display**
   - Shows exact number of units preventing deletion
   - Directs user to Units page to delete them

3. **Success Redirect**
   - Redirects to properties list after successful deletion
   - Shows success message with property name

**Error Message Examples:**
```
"Cannot delete property with active tenant assignments. 
Found 3 unit(s) with active tenants. 
Please terminate all tenant assignments first, then delete the units."

"Cannot delete property with existing units. 
Found 5 unit(s). 
Please delete all units first from the Units page."
```

#### Updated Confirmation Dialog (edit-apartment.blade.php)
**Location:** Lines 968-972

**Changes:**
- More informative confirmation message
- Explains deletion requirements clearly
- Warns about units needing deletion first

## Deletion Workflow

### To Delete a Property:
1. **Step 1:** Terminate all active tenant assignments
   - Go to Tenant Assignments
   - Set status to 'terminated' for each active assignment
   
2. **Step 2:** Delete all units
   - Go to Units page
   - Click Delete button on each unit
   - Units with no active tenants will be deleted
   
3. **Step 3:** Delete the property
   - Go to Edit Property page
   - Click "Delete Property" button
   - Property will be deleted if no units remain

### To Delete a Unit:
1. **Check Status:** Unit must not have active tenant assignments
2. **Click Delete:** Click the red Delete button on the unit card
3. **Confirm:** Confirm the deletion in the dialog
4. **Result:** Unit is deleted if no active assignments exist

## Safety Features

### Protection Against Data Loss:
1. ✅ Cannot delete properties with units
2. ✅ Cannot delete units with active tenants
3. ✅ Confirmation dialogs for all deletions
4. ✅ Clear error messages explaining why deletion failed
5. ✅ Guidance on what steps to take next
6. ✅ Ownership verification (landlords can only delete their own)
7. ✅ Transaction safety with try-catch blocks
8. ✅ Error logging for debugging

### Cascade Behavior:
- Terminated/completed assignments are deleted with the unit
- Active assignments block unit deletion
- Units block property deletion

## Files Modified

1. **app/Http/Controllers/LandlordController.php**
   - Added `deleteUnit()` method (lines 323-352)
   - Enhanced `deleteApartment()` method (lines 147-177)

2. **routes/web.php**
   - Added delete unit route (line 76)

3. **resources/views/landlord/units.blade.php**
   - Added Delete button (lines 747-749)
   - Added `deleteUnit()` JavaScript function (lines 1199-1223)

4. **resources/views/landlord/edit-apartment.blade.php**
   - Updated confirmation dialog (lines 968-972)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Delete unit without active tenants → Should succeed
- [ ] Delete unit with active tenant → Should fail with clear message
- [ ] Delete property without units → Should succeed
- [ ] Delete property with units → Should fail with unit count
- [ ] Delete property with units having active tenants → Should fail with tenant count
- [ ] Verify only landlord can delete their own units/properties
- [ ] Check success messages display correctly
- [ ] Check error messages display correctly
- [ ] Verify redirects work properly
- [ ] Test confirmation dialogs appear

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Guidance:** Error messages tell users exactly what to do
2. **Safety First:** Multiple confirmation steps prevent accidents
3. **Visual Feedback:** Red delete buttons clearly indicate destructive action
4. **Informative Dialogs:** Confirmations explain consequences
5. **Proper Flow:** System guides users through the correct deletion order

## Security

- ✅ CSRF protection on all delete forms
- ✅ Ownership verification via landlord_id
- ✅ Authorization via route middleware
- ✅ SQL injection protection via Eloquent ORM
- ✅ Input validation via whereNumber() route constraint
