# Tenant Prospect Flow - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Modified the tenant registration and login flow to redirect new tenants (prospects without unit assignments) to the property listings page instead of showing a "No Assignment" message.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Tenant Dashboard Logic
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/TenantAssignmentController.php`
- Updated `tenantDashboard()` method (line 283-294)
- Changed behavior: When a tenant has no unit assignment, redirect to the explore page with an informational message
- Previously: Showed a "no-assignment" view

### 2. Enhanced Explore Page UI
**File:** `resources/views/explore.blade.php`

#### Added Navigation Bar (lines 338-385)
- Logo and branding
- Login/Logout buttons
- User name display for logged-in tenants
- Dashboard link for assigned tenants
- Register button for guests

#### Added Prospect Tenant Banners (lines 319-336)
- Session-based info message display
- Persistent banner for logged-in prospect tenants
- Clear messaging about their status
- Dismissible alerts

### 3. Updated Tenant Sidebar Navigation
**Files Modified:**
- `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` (lines 504-506)
- `resources/views/partials/tenant-sidebar.blade.php` (lines 11-13)

**Changes:**
- Added "Browse Properties" link with search icon
- Positioned after Dashboard for easy access
- Active state highlighting when on explore page

## User Flow

### New Tenant Registration
1. User registers as a tenant
2. System creates tenant account
3. User is redirected to `/tenant/dashboard`
4. Controller detects no assignment
5. User is redirected to `/explore` with info message
6. User sees property listings and can browse

### Prospect Tenant Experience
- See welcome banner with their name
- Can filter and search properties
- Can view property details
- Have navigation bar with logout option
- Can access dashboard (which redirects back to explore)

### Assigned Tenant Experience
- Can access their tenant dashboard
- Still have access to "Browse Properties" in sidebar
- Can explore other available properties
- Have full navigation between all tenant features

## Benefits
1. **Better UX:** No confusing "No Assignment" message
2. **Lead Generation:** Tenants can browse properties immediately
3. **Flexibility:** Even assigned tenants can browse other properties
4. **Clear Communication:** Informative banners explain the user's status
5. **Seamless Navigation:** Easy to switch between browsing and dashboard

## Routes Involved
- `GET /explore` - Property listings (public/authenticated)
- `GET /tenant/dashboard` - Tenant dashboard (redirects prospects)
- `GET /property/{slug}` - Property details page

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Register new tenant account
- [ ] Verify redirect to explore page
- [ ] Check info banner displays

- [ ] Verify navbar shows user name
- [ ] Test logout functionality

## Notes
- Explore page is accessible to both authenticated and guest users
- Tenants without assignments are considered "prospects"
- The flow maintains all existing functionality for assigned tenants
- No database changes required
